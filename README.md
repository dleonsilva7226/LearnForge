## 🚀 What Makes LearnForge Unique

> Not just another to-do app with courses. This project stands out through its **purpose, design**, and **technical polish**.

### 🧠 Focused on Independent Creators
- Unlike Moodle or Blackboard (built for institutions), LearnForge is tailored for **individual instructors, creators, and niche communities** who want their own platform — not to live under someone else’s.

### 🧱 Customizable & Self-Hosted
- LearnForge can be deployed and branded by anyone, making it a starting point for **SaaS-style monetization** or **bootstrapped teaching businesses**.

### 🔐 Secure Role-Based Design
- Fully implemented role system for Instructors and Students
- Clear access control boundaries using **JWT**
- Data scoped to user role and identity

### 📈 Built to Scale
- Smart data modeling: Users → Courses → Lessons → Progress
- Easily expandable: Add quizzes, payments, notifications, etc.
- Stateless backend with flexible frontend integration

### 💼 Resume-Ready, Production-Deployed
- Live frontend on **Vercel**, backend on **Fly.io**
- Uses realistic auth, environment variables, CORS config, and route protection
- Includes **seeded demo accounts**, so recruiters can test it in 60 seconds
